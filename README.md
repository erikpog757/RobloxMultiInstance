# How to use multi instance
1. The program automatically launches the first Roblox window.

2. Then, open the second or multiple additional Roblox windows either through the website or by launching them normally.

3. Log into a different Roblox account in each of the new windows.

4. Use the multiple instances as you need.

This multi instance really works after the latest Roblox patch.
