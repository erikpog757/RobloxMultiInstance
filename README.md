# Roblox Multi-Instance by erikpog757
#This program allows you to run multiple Roblox instances simultaneously.

# Usage Instructions
Launch the build or release available on this GitHub repository to start the program.

For best results, use the Alt Manager from the official Roblox website when logging into different accounts.

Opening Roblox normally without using an Alt Manager will cause you to be forcibly logged out of your account.

It is recommended not to close the program during active sessions to avoid interruptions or account issues.

# If you follow these guidelines, you can manage multiple Roblox accounts smoothly and securely.
